# Object Orientation Basics Conclusion

Now we should have a basic grasp on object-oriented programming. As discussed in
this section, we should have an understanding of the concept of "objects" that
can contain data and/or code, such as attributes and methods.

In this section we explained the concept of local variables and instance
variables, as well as instance methods. We learned about setter and getter
methods, as well as how to abstract away some of the repetitive code using
attribute accessor macros. We can now set instance variables from our
`#initialize` method.

What we will be able to achieve is shared functionality throughout the
application as needed. You're well on our way to having enough knowledge of OOP
to develop your own fully functional applications!
